Creating a Developer Ecosystem
===================
As I continue to work with PLG companies, one of the common themes is building an ecosystem. As a result, I pulled together a framework to help companies think through this.

It all starts with understanding the personas you’re targeting and why they need what you’re delivering. If it can’t help them gain users or unlock revenue, they might not get value from your offering. Focus on the pain point you’re helping them overcome.
Nail your personas! — you should have the primary user, secondary user and potentially a decision maker if it’s not 1 or 2. Bringing in a Developer Relations lead is also highly encouraged.
Attract your personas. A) talk with your personas, B) Keep track of phrases they use when describing problems and motivations because that what you use in your marketing and website, C) Go to where they hangout (blogs, newsletters, meetups, communities, social networks)
Make sure you have something that can deliver value. If this doesn’t help them solve problems or obtain recognition, restart the process. That’s fundamental. Beyond that you need to reduce the friction to getting started. Have clear APIs and Dev Tools, ensure Docs are stellar, and have education available on how to build (webinars, youtube, code samples).
Track and measure. Typically usage is a proxy for value, but there are multiple ways to slice this. It really depends on your product. For example Slack measured the number of things actively built that are used.
Scaling this once it’s rolling. Bringing in a Developer Marketer to work with Dev Rel to expand the outreach from 1:1 to 1:many. They can help establish a community and other programs.
Note usage is harder to quantify value, but it is proven there is long term value and strategic importance. It leads users: 1) Stay with the product (Retention), 2) More likely to expand, 3) More likely to pay over time, and 4) Harder to rip and replace.
